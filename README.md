# Pinpin - New generation of Resume

## Contributors

## Motivation
Pinpin is a new kind of resume. Commonly, anyone would face these steps in every interview if they attend one. First of all, the interviewer will ask the interviewees to guide through their resume. Secondly, the interviewees would be required to give some information about themselves. Lastly, the interviewees will be asked to say something about their previous experience at maybe their universities or companies.
The steps above happen nearly every interview. Both interviewer and interviewees have to repeat these steps hundreds of time without having a chance to properly prepare and having polish practice. Thus, we as a team came up with the solution for this issue which can allow the interviewees to prepare for themselves how to explain to interviewer properly and clearly as well as to be active in showcasing the skills to the interviewer practically. In the near future, the number of jobs is not enough for everyone even the one who has the bachelor degree or similar to that. With this approach, the interviewee can be actively seperate themselves from other applicants and bring in higher chance to be able to get the job. Your responsibility, our tool, your career.
